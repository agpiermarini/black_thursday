Project: Black Thursday

Group Member Names: Clee Pollock and Andrew Piermarini

Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project? To complete the project successfully while
developing a further understanding of key concepts, such as Law of Demeter, etc.

Goals and expectations: Our goal is to complete the project by the end of the week of 2/19. We expect to divide project responsibilities equally, carrying out as much of the work as possible together in person.

Team strengths: Work ethic and commitment. A good baseline understanding of ruby and object-oriented programming.

How to overcome obstacles: We will work through obstacles related to the project by doing our due diligence and seeking
assistance when necessary.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?): We have both agreed to put as much time
into the project as necessary, and have committed to being available on weekends and afternoons after class as necessary, to be determined.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?): We will communicate daily in person and remotely via slack to both set goals for the day/week and check in as to our progress toward
those goals. We will implement Git Workflow and review each other's pull requests.

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): Covered above. We both recognize that there
is room for improvement in all areas and hope to capitalize on the opportunity to learn throughout our project work.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): Even workload. Exact division of tasks to be determined.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests): See above.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: We intend to be open and honest with one another and to provide feedback, at
a minimum, when we complete the project, if not during.

Agenda to discuss project launch: We are discussing the project launch as soon as we are done with our DTR.

Ideas: TBD

Tools: GitHub, Atom, Waffle, VS Code, Terminal, Hound, SimpleCov, Minitest, as well as CSV parsing tools, if available.
